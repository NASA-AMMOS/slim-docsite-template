# API Overview

Welcome to the **[Project Name]** API documentation. This section provides detailed information about the API endpoints, parameters, request and response formats, and example usage. Use this guide to integrate **[Project Name]** with your applications and services.

## Getting Started

Before using the API, ensure that you have:

- **API Key**: You need an API key to authenticate your requests. You can obtain one by [registering an account](#) on our platform.
- **Base URL**: All API endpoints are accessible via the following base URL:
  ```
  https://api.yourprojectname.com/v1
  ```
- **Authentication**: Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
  ```

## Authentication

### API Key Authentication

All requests to the **[Project Name]** API must include an API key for authentication. Here's how to include your API key in the header:

```http
GET /v1/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: api.yourprojectname.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. Below are the common status codes you might encounter:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The resource was successfully created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed or user does not have permissions.
- **403 Forbidden**: The user does not have access rights to the content.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an error and could not complete your request.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and stability of the API, rate limiting is enforced on all endpoints. The default rate limit is [X requests per minute]. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### Rate Limit Headers

Each response includes rate limit headers that provide information about your current usage:

- **X-RateLimit-Limit**: The maximum number of requests you can make in a given time window.
- **X-RateLimit-Remaining**: The number of requests remaining in the current time window.
- **X-RateLimit-Reset**: The time at which the rate limit will reset, in UTC epoch seconds.

## Webhooks

### 1. Setting Up Webhooks

**Description**: Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when certain events occur within **[Project Name]**. You can configure webhooks to send data to your specified endpoint.

**Example Use Cases**:
- Notify your system when a new resource is created.
- Trigger an action in your application when a resource is updated.

#### Configuring Webhooks

1. **Create a Webhook**: Send a `POST` request to `/v1/webhooks` with your endpoint URL.
   ```http
   POST /v1/webhooks HTTP/1.1
   Host: api.yourprojectname.com
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "url": "https://yourapp.com/webhook-endpoint",
     "event": "resource.created"
   }
   ```

2. **Handle Webhook Events**: Set up your endpoint to receive and process webhook payloads.

#### Example Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "event": "resource.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "125",
    "name": "New Resource",
    "description": "A description for the new resource.",
    "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Versioning

The API is versioned to ensure backward compatibility. The current version is `v1`. When making requests, include the version number in the URL, e.g., `/v1/resources`.

> **Note**: Always check the documentation for the latest version and deprecated features.
